Fictional Sailboat Charter Company Database System

For a fictional sailboat charter company, I designed and implemented a database system to manage boat leasing operations using MySQL. The system was tailored to handle boat rentals, customer data, and equipment tracking for Caribbean Sailboat Charters, a company specializing in leasing sailboats owned by individuals.

Key components of the project include:

    Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD): I developed an ERD that captures all necessary entities, including boats, owners, customers, charters, and maintenance activities. The ERD is meant to help more technical stakeholders to better visualize the relationships between entities.

    Relational Schema: The logical design was normalized to ensure efficiency and scalability. This schema structure was normalized in 3rd normal form.

    Workflow Diagram: A workflow diagram was created to visualize the business process, from customer booking to boat returns, and customer reports. This also lays a foundation for an application.

    Dashboard using Power BI: To provide actionable insights for decision-making, I developed a Power BI dashboard. This dashboard visually represents key metrics such as charter frequency, boat utilization rates, and yearly sales.

    MySQL Database: The underlying database was implemented in MySQL, where I created tables, relationships, and appropriate constraints. I also ensured the system enforced important business rules, such as preventing overbooking, preventing customers with large outstanding balances from booking, and calculating penalties for late returns.
