Fictional Sailboat Charter Company Database System

For a fictional sailboat charter company, I designed and implemented a robust database system to manage boat leasing operations using MySQL. The system was tailored to handle boat rentals, customer data, and equipment tracking for Caribbean Sailboat Charters, a company specializing in leasing sailboats owned by individuals.

Key components of the project include:

    Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD): I developed an ERD that captures all necessary entities, including boats, owners, customers, charters, and maintenance activities. The ERD defined the relationships between entities like boat ownership, rental transactions, and crew management.

    Relational Schema: The logical design was normalized to ensure efficiency and scalability. This schema structured the data into well-defined tables, such as boats, charters, customers, and equipment.

    Workflow Diagram: A comprehensive workflow diagram was created to visualize the business process, from customer booking to equipment management and post-rental maintenance.

    Dashboard using Power BI: To provide actionable insights for decision-making, I developed a Power BI dashboard. This dashboard visually represents key metrics such as charter frequency, boat utilization rates, and maintenance costs.

    MySQL Database: The underlying database was implemented in MySQL, where I created tables, relationships, and appropriate constraints. I also ensured the system enforced important business rules, such as preventing overbooking, tracking maintenance activities, and calculating penalties for late returns.
